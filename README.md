# Azuki Stickers

Hi Everyone! Azuki just recently published a list of Beanz emojis, via their [Bilibili collab announcement](https://twitter.com/AzukiOfficial/status/1615723263870799873). These emojis are amazing to use and really live up the spirit of your conversation. I use it everyday! The world is going to love using these stickers to express themselves üåç! This repo is a collection of various Beanz stickers on the Azuki discord channel. You can install them to your computer.

Also, there are programs that you help scrape other stickers, even those that are not Azuki related. Just check out the `discord_web_scraper.js`, `stickers.json` and `download_script.py`.

Enjoy! Let's spread the love of Beanz to the entire world!
